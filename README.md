# Overcoming Gemini API Limitations

This guide was compiled from collective research and personal contributions by the author and ChatGPT—because, frankly, Gemini’s documentation (and responses) left much to be desired. This guide aims to help developers understand what Gemini currently cannot do and how to work around these limitations.
1. Limitations of the Gemini API
a. Stateless Nature and Lack of Persistent Conversation History

    No Native Context Persistence:
    Gemini processes each request in isolation. It does not remember previous interactions unless you explicitly pass the conversation history.

    In-Memory ChatSession:
    The SDK’s ChatSession object manages conversation history during an active session. However, it stores the data in RAM only—so if the process restarts or crashes, the history is lost.

b. Unsupported File Formats for Images

    Vector Graphics:
    Gemini only accepts raster image formats (PNG, JPEG, WebP) for multimodal inputs. Vector formats (e.g., SVG, EPS, AI) are not supported directly.

c. Other Noted Shortcomings

    Context Window Management:
    Although models like Gemini 1.5 Pro support very large context windows (up to 2 million tokens), there is still a need to manage token usage efficiently—especially in long conversations.

    Cost Considerations:
    Repeatedly sending extensive conversation history or large context inputs may lead to increased processing costs if not managed through strategies like context caching.

2. Workarounds and Best Practices
a. Handling Conversation History

    Explicitly Transmit Context:
    Always include the relevant conversation history in the payload of each request. Format this as an array of messages with roles (e.g., "user", "model").

    Persist History Externally:
    Implement client-side persistence by saving conversation logs to an external database or storage service.
        Options include:
            NoSQL Databases: Firestore, MongoDB
            Relational Databases: PostgreSQL, MySQL
            Local Storage: Browser localStorage or IndexedDB (for simple, client-only apps)
            Cloud Storage: Google Cloud Storage, AWS S3 (for JSON logs)

    Leverage In-Memory Sessions for Short-Term Needs:
    Use the ChatSession object provided by the Gemini SDK to manage the conversation during an active session. Then, persist the session’s history externally once the session ends.

b. Overcoming Image Format Limitations

    Convert Vector to Raster:
    Before sending images to Gemini, convert any vector images (SVG, EPS, AI) to a supported raster format (PNG, JPEG, or WebP).
        Tools such as Inkscape or online converters can automate this conversion.

c. Efficient Context Management

    Monitor Token Usage:
    Regularly check the length of your conversation history. Implement strategies like:
        Truncating or Summarizing Older Messages: Keep the most relevant context to stay within the token limits.
        Using Context-Caching: If your application frequently reuses the same initial context, investigate Gemini’s context-caching options to reduce redundancy and cost.

3. Conclusion

The Gemini API, by design, is stateless and expects the client to manage context persistence. Additionally, it only supports specific media formats for image inputs, leaving vector graphics unsupported. By implementing persistent storage for conversation logs, explicitly transmitting context in every request, converting unsupported image formats, and managing your token usage efficiently, developers can overcome these limitations and build more robust, context-aware applications.

Note: This guide is the result of combined efforts and research by the author and ChatGPT—because Gemini was too “dumb” (and its documentation too opaque) to provide clear answers. If you’ve encountered similar issues, you’re not alone.

# Result

Still yet Gemini is big shit for DevOps & advanced user test it self!
