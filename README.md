# Limitations of the Gemini API

## a. Stateless Nature and Lack of Persistent Conversation History

- **No Native Context Persistence:** Gemini processes each request in isolation. It does not store previous interactions unless you explicitly provide the conversation history.
- **In-Memory ChatSession:** The SDK's ChatSession object manages conversation history only during an active session. However, this data is stored in RAM—if the process restarts or crashes, the history is lost.

## b. Additional Notable Limitations

- **Context Window Management:** While models like Gemini 1.5 Pro support very large context windows (up to 2 million tokens), it is still necessary to manage token usage efficiently, especially in long conversations.
- **Cost Considerations:** Repeatedly sending extensive conversation histories or large context inputs can lead to increased processing costs if not managed with strategies like Context Caching.

# Workarounds and Best Practices

## a. Handling Conversation History

- **Explicitly Transmit Context:** Always include the relevant conversation history in each request payload. Format it as an array of messages with roles (e.g., "user", "model").
- **Persist History Externally:** Implement client-side persistence by storing conversation logs in an external database or storage service.
- **Storage Options Include:**
  - NoSQL databases (Firestore, MongoDB)
  - Relational databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL)
  - Local storage (browser localStorage or IndexedDB for simple client-side apps)
  - Cloud storage (Google Cloud Storage, AWS S3 for JSON logs)
- **Leverage In-Memory Sessions for Short-Term Needs:** Use the Gemini SDK's ChatSession object to manage conversation history during an active session, then persist the session history externally when it ends.

## b. Efficient Context Management

- **Monitor Token Usage:** Regularly check the length of your conversation history and implement strategies like:
  - **Truncating or Summarizing Older Messages:** Keep only the most relevant context to stay within token limits.
  - **Using Context-Caching:** If your application frequently reuses the same initial context, explore Gemini’s Context-Caching options to reduce redundancy and costs.
